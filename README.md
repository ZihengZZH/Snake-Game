# Snake-Game
This repo records an MFC implementation of Snake game.

## MFC Framework
Microsoft Foundation Class Library ([MFC](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k9kb0kba.aspx)) is a C++ object-oriented library for developing desktop applications for Windows. This framework enables developers not only to create simple desktop applications but also to develop complex user interfaces with multiple controls. MFC framework provides several structures, including Single Document Interface (SDI), Multiple Document Interface (MDI) and Dialog Based Applications. The Document-View architecture is both critical and necessary to applications because it improves robustness and reduces coupling. So the architecture has been applied in this project.

## Snake Game
The intended goals of the game includes single-player mode, save and open the game, different speed options, different theme options, keyboard and button control, leader-board information, and about information. All these functionalties have been achieved and its Release version might be executable on different computers. Please refers to Screenshots to see the game GUI.

However, the communication with XML files might be problematic and so is playing sound (wav file). Possibly a more robust version will be modified later on.
